# CS300-Portfolio
This is my completed course work from CS300

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In the CS 300 course, the primary focus was on applying data structures to solve real-world problems efficiently. The projects involved organizing, managing, and retrieving data using different structures like linked lists, trees, graphs, and hash tables to optimize performance. The goal was to understand how choosing the right data structure impacts both the speed and scalability of software.

# How did you approach the problem?
I approached the problem by carefully analyzing the type of data being handled and selecting the most appropriate data structure for the task. Understanding how data is stored and accessed allowed me to make informed decisions about which structure would provide the most efficient solution, particularly in terms of time and space complexity. This course emphasized the importance of data structures as they form the foundation for developing efficient and scalable programs.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When I encountered challenges, such as difficulty in implementing or choosing the correct data structure, I used a combination of strategies. These included reviewing documentation, breaking the problem into smaller pieces, and seeking guidance from peers or instructors. Debugging was an essential part of the process, where I learned to trace the flow of data and identify bottlenecks or errors in the logic.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
Working on this project has deepened my understanding of how to approach software design from a performance-first perspective. I've learned the value of upfront planning, especially when it comes to choosing the right data structures. This experience has taught me how to analyze the problem requirements and think about long-term maintainability and efficiency from the start.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project reinforced the importance of writing clean, well-documented code that others (or even my future self) can easily understand and maintain. Iâ€™ve become more mindful of structuring my code to be modular, using functions and classes to break down tasks, and ensuring that my code is flexible enough to adapt to future changes or additional features. By focusing on readability and maintainability, I've developed a habit of considering both immediate functionality and long-term scalability.
